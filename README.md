# Who are we?

cunnygarten = cunny + garden

We are a diverse group of people who are united by our love for ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­. We believe that through the lens of ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ and technology, we can discover the fun and beauty in everything around us.

We don't believe in disciplinary boundaries. As we think that all knowledge is connected, and that by breaking down barriers we can learn more and create more ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ things.

We connect people through events, meetups, hackathons, and much more. We strive to create an environment where à¸ à¸±à¸¢à¸ªà¸±à¸‡à¸„à¸¡ can come together to collaborate, share ideas, and learn from each other.

We stand for:

- ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­: We believe that ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ is a fundamental human quality that should be nurtured and encouraged. We believe that everyone has the potential to be ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­, and that the world is a better place when we all express our ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­.

- Empathy: We believe in putting ourselves in others' shoes, and using our skills to make a positive impact on the world.

- Fun: We believe that work should be enjoyable, and that every day is an opportunity to learn something new and have some fun.

The name Cunnygarten comes from the word cunny and garten, as in Kindergarten, which means _children_'s garden in German. We chose this name because we want to create a garden for all à¸ à¸±à¸¢à¸ªà¸±à¸‡à¸„à¸¡ where they can come to create, learn, and share.

We invite you to join us on this journey of exploration and ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­. Together, letâ€™s ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­.
